## Push_swap

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

## Installation

```bash
git clone
```

## Usage

```bash
make
./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1
```
